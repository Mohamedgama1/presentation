        <H3>What is drift by cars </H3>
    </section>
    <p>With the development and spread of drifting, it is no longer just a driving style, but rather has evolved into a full-fledged motor sport for which tournaments and challenges are held and based on specific judging criteria through    which the best drivers and those most capable of following the correct drift can be selected.
        The greater the angle of deflection of the car during its start, the more points the racer gains. The closer the car is to the narrowest <mark>poin</mark> in the turn during drifting or to any side barriers in general, the more points it will increase. Likewise, the more the wheels squeal and the amount of smoke that these wheels emit as they drift at speed increases. The audience had a good show and the driver got more points.
